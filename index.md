# Monolith

**Monolith** is a science fiction adventure game for one Game Master (GM) and at least one other player. Players act as daring adventurers exploring a vast & mysterious galaxy filled with weird aliens, lost civilizations, and ruthless factions.

## Overview
**Monolith** is about exploring a vast, populous, and diverse galaxy. It’s a game of discovery, wonder, and mystery. Monolith is setting neutral. The rules are written in such a way that might suggest or imply things like specific cultures, alien lifeforms, psionics, weird powers, intelligent machines, advanced technology existing alongside more analogue or “low tech” technology, and faster-than-light travel. As a galaxy that is both an open society full of trade and conflict, while also leaving dark corners and uncharted sections to explore. Some of the items, backgrounds, and powers imply certain elements of a setting, but the flavor of everything can be changed to suit your needs. 

The rules are also modular enough to be altered or removed. If you don’t want starships, or faction management, or psionic powers, certain elements of backgrounds, combat, etc. you should feel encouraged to alter the game to suit your needs. Monolith is also designed with longer play and campaigns in mind, although it would work fine for one-shots. That’s why there are systems of progression, and why new characters might seem a little more well-geared and tougher than new characters in similar games. I tend to play with longer campaigns in mind. If you don’t, it should be easy enough to increase the challenge on the GM side to find the right difficulty for your table.

# Principles

### Compatibility
This game is designed to be compatible with other pre-written adventures (especially sci-fi) with minimal and flexible conversion.
### Modularity
All rules are optional. Use what you want, remove what you don’t. Everything is designed to be modular. You can pull whole parts out, slot in optional rules, and add your own homebrew content. Some campaigns are short, others go on for many sessions. Some tables want lighter games, others want lots of content and systems. Handwave rules and features to your heart’s content!
### Minimal Implied Setting
Some aspects of a setting are implied, such as alien species, psionics and space magic, starships, cybernetics, and more. Most of the setting was kept intentionally vague so that the GM and players can customize how their galaxy looks and what they draw inspiration from. Most of the rules are modular enough that they can be modified or removed if they don’t work at your table.
### Classless
A character’s role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty. They have a background, which tells you a bit about their experiences before becoming an adventurer, but it doesn’t define who they can become.
### Danger & Consequences
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to danger. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning. Sometimes there are consequences other than death that can change who you are, or even alter the galaxy itself.
### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the GM in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Always rule in favor of fun if everyone is in agreement.
### Narrative Growth
Characters are mostly changed through in-world actions and consequences. Players may acquire new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events or overcoming obstacles. Dangerous and valuable technology and artifacts will often change a character. Characters also have the incentive of acquiring experience points via credits recovered from hunting rare objects or completing dangerous jobs. 
### Shared Objectives
Players should trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.
### Hackable Abilities & Items
Many of the effects of psionics, astromancy, talents, experimental tech, artifacts, and various augmentations can be shifted around. Magic effects can be items instead. Something a piece of tech does could be an ability or talent instead. There’s a lot of overlap, and that’s intentional. Borrow, shift around, and reflavor as you see fit.
### Adventure
One shots are perfectly acceptable ways to play, but this game was designed with several sessions to campaign length play in mind. Characters may start out with a few more advantages than other games, but that’s okay. The universe is still deadly enough to impose serious challenges when needed.
### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently. Always give the players a lot of information.

# Character Creation

## Ability Scores
Roll **3d6** for each ability score in order. The player may swap any two of the results.
* **Strength (STR)** - Power, toughness, grit, & stamina.
* **Dexterity (DEX)** - Quickness, precision, agility, & technological aptitude.
* **Willpower (WIL)** - Confidence, force of personality, mental fortitude, & affinity for the weird.

## Background
Roll **1d12** and consult the corresponding background to see what your life has been like up to this point. Next, roll on all the tables listed under that background. All backgrounds will have a table corresponding to HP, along with two other tables to flesh out details.

## Hit Protection (HP)
Roll **1d6** to determine your character’s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see Healing). They grow more grizzled over their experiences. If an attack takes a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the scars table.

## Finishing Touches
Roll on any additional tables for your background and see the finishing touches section for optional traits. The oldest player at the table will reference their background’s group debt.

## Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:
* Three days of rations (one slot)
* Cheap Data-Comm (one slot)
* Glo-torch (one slot)
* 3d6 Credits (C)

# Backgrounds

## Background Details
Some elements from your past might still be relevant to who your character is or might become, but their past doesn’t define them. Backgrounds will also imply some specialized knowledge, along with details based on the tables rolled.

## Shared Debt
The group will start with a shared debt. This will help facilitate urgency for the players by prompting them to search out jobs and make money, as well as provide the GM with world building and story prompts. 

## Tags
Each background comes with various traits expressed as [tags]. These are simple descriptors that are truths about a character. They don’t directly offer mechanical bonuses, but can be used as a tool when negotiating between the player and the GM or deciding an outcome. Character qualities don’t have to be tags to be used this way, but they’re labeled this way to help organize a new character’s details before play. As characters interact with the setting, more truths and descriptions about them will be added, either as tags or just with common sense. Tags can optionally be ignored. 

## Alternate Background Options
If players prefer to create a character without a background, reference the chart on pages 32-33. Players will roll their stats as normal, roll 1d6 HP, and reference the chart according to their highest stat and their HP. This will give them a starting package that may include weapons, powers, equipment, and other character features.
